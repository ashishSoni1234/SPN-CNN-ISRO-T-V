# 🛰️ Spacecraft Pose Estimation using SPN (SpaceNet-CNN)

This repository contains a PyTorch-based implementation of **SPN (Spacecraft Pose Network)** for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation using single  images. The model is trained and evaluated on the [SPEED Dataset], specifically tailored for spacecrafts.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The SPN architecture is a two-headed model that includes:

- **CNN Backbone**: 5-layer convolutional pipeline with LRN, MaxPool (AlexNet-style).
- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Uses anchors to propose bounding boxes.
- **RoIAlign + RoIHeads**: Feature pooling and regression/classification heads.
- **Classification Head**: Predicts quaternion class distribution (5000 classes).
- **Regression Head**: Predicts continuous attitude quaternion.

**Output:**
- `c`: Classification logits `[B x 5000]`
- `r`: Regressed quaternion `[B x 4]`
- `detections`: Final box proposals

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is measured using:

- **Orientation Error (ER)**: Angular error in degrees between predicted and ground-truth quaternions.
- **Translation Error (ET)**: Euclidean distance in meters between predicted and ground-truth translation vectors.

## 📦 Dataset

- **Name**: [SPEED (Satellite Pose Estimation) Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/6327547)
- **Components**:
  - Greyscale  images of spacecrafts tango
  - Ground truth 3D keypoints(postion and quaternion)
  - 12000 images  synthetic images generated by generated by SLAB's Optical Simulator
  - 5 real images
